Welcome to the OpenNMS @appversion@ installer!

Before installation, make sure you've got PostgreSQL (8.3 or higher)
and a Sun-compatible JDK installed.

On Windows, just run the appropriate setup executable in this directory.
Note that you can use setup32.exe on 64-bit Windows, but you must have a
32-bit JVM installed for it to run.

On other platforms, you can launch the .jar file directly.

For details on installation, please see:
